Hi, my name is Łukasz Więckowski, and I am a front-end developer specializing in building web applications.

I am a graduate of Paweł Włodkowic University in Płock, where I completed my engineering studies in Computer Science with a specialization in Programming and Databases.

Since the early days of my studies, I have been focusing on web mastering, particularly on front-end technologies. My favorite technologies include React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

In my work, I also utilize technologies such as Material UI, Redux, and Sass. In the past, I have worked on full-stack projects using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.
