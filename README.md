Hi, my name is Łukasz Więckowski, for three years I am interested in creating web applications.

I am a graduate of the Pawel Wlodkowic University College in Płock. I graduated from the Faculty of Computer Science with a specialization in programming and databases.

Practically from the beginning of my studies I focused my attention on webmastering, especially on front-end technologies. My favorite technologies are ReactJS and Saas.

I have done one commercial project which I did at the beginning of my studies. Currently I am looking for a job as a Junior Front-End Developer.
